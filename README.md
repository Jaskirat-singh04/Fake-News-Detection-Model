# Fake-News-Detection-Model
The code is written in Python and uses various libraries to analyze and process text data from two CSV files: "Fake.csv" and "True.csv". 

this code is a simple demonstration of how to analyze and process text data using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn libraries in Python. The code is intended for educational purposes only and shows how to perform some basic exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of fake and real news articles.

The code is structured in a way that should make it easy to understand and modify for use with other datasets. However, it should be noted that this code is not optimized for efficiency or performance and may not be suitable for large datasets.

To use this code, the user will need to have the necessary libraries installed in their Python environment. The code reads data from two CSV files, "Fake.csv" and "True.csv", which should be located in a "data" directory in the same directory as the code.

The code can be run by simply executing the script in a Python environment or from a Jupyter notebook. The output will be generated in the form of various plots and a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifier.

The code can be modified to suit other text datasets by changing the file names and paths, modifying the cleaning and processing steps, and adjusting the visualization and analysis techniques as needed.
